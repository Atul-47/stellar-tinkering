# Dispute resolution 

This scenario is very similar to the agreement with pre-auth tx example, though a trusted third-party is added here.

The idea is that before the escrowed account proceeding period starts, Alice *or* Bob can trigger a dispute resolution transaction.

The dispute resolution transaction will give a trusted third-party account the ability to execute a proceed or recover transaction.
